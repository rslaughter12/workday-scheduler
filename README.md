This project was designed to give the user an easy and simple task manager that allows them to set and store their daily tasks in their local storage as well as have an interface that changes colors based on the current time of day and the time of the event that is on their schedule. 

The main function that is present in the JS script sheet is the one that is grabbing the user's local time and then using that in the following function to have the css sheet respond to it by changing the color. 

The other functions that are present withint the JS script are saving the information from the local storage upon a click of the save button. 

The boxes are coming from the HTML and that is where the APIs that are being used to gather the local time and pull that information back and around the site is linked at the bottom of the document. 
Within the HTML document there are the boxes that have been created in order for the user to have the seperate hours of their day. 

I did believe that my code is set up properly, however, I do have a small issue where the boxes are not always color responsive.
